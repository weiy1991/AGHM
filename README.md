# Adaptive Gradient Harmonized Mechanism

## Overview
---
This repository contains the source code for the Adaptive Gradient Harmonized Mechanism (AGHM) for the End-to-End Steering Estimation, which has been submitted to ICRA2020.

The main idea is build an Adaptive Gradient Harmonized Mechanism to hedge the gradient disharmony during model training.

The detalied architecture of the AGHM is as following:

### Dependencies
This requires:

* tensorflow1.4
* python3.6


Here, I use python3.6 with anaconda3. You can configure your own python environment as you want.
